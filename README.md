# Dinamic-Stack-play
In this code I wanted to play with the data using a dynamic stack, in this code I insert it into the stack, remove it from the stack, see the items in the stack, print the data from the stack in the reverse order of what is stored and finally I check if the word of the stack is a palindrome.
